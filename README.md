# Data Cleaning & Transformation

## Introduction.
In this project, my main focus is transforming and cleaning data while referring to the business demand overview, and the business request. I like to start off by identifying which tables I need based on the user stories, business demand overview, and business request before getting into the actual data cleaning and transformation.



## Dataset
AdventureWorks Database is a Microsoft product sample for an online transaction processing (OLTP) database. The AdventureWorks Database supports a fictitious, multinational manufacturing company called Adventure Works Cycles.


## Highlight
Referring back to the email, I’m able to identify tables I’ll need for this report transformation.
-	Internet sales 
-	Customer table
-	Product table
-	Calendar table

# Tables
